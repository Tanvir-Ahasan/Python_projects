This is a collection of Python projects that I have created as a part of my learning journey in Python programming language. These projects are a mix of fun games, simple applications, and small data science projects.

# Projects Included
madlibs_story.py: This is a fun game where you can create silly stories by filling in the blanks with random words.

Guess the number.py: This is a guessing game where the computer or the user can guess the number.

Temperature converter.py: This is a simple temperature converter that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

Rock Paper Sissor.py: This is a classic game of rock-paper-scissors that you can play against the computer.

To-do-list.py: This is a simple to-do list application that allows you to add, remove, and view tasks.

Simple calculator.py: This is a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Currency converter.py: This is a currency converter that converts between various currencies using real-time exchange rates.

Line graph.ipynb: This is a small data science project that demonstrates how to create a line graph using Python's matplotlib library.

Pong.py: This is a classic game of Pong that you can play against the computer.

Web scraper.py: This is a web scraper that extracts data from a website.

## Getting Started
To run any of these projects, you will need Python installed on your computer. Simply download the project files and run the Python script in your terminal or IDE. You may need to install additional libraries, which are mentioned in the comments at the beginning of each file.

## Contributions

For example, the game "Pong" is a classic game that has been around for decades and is not my original creation. I have created my own version of the game using Python programming language as a practice exercise.
